        <p>Access to Work can help you get or stay in work if you have a physical or mental health condition or disability.</p>

<p>The support you get will depend on your needs. Through Access to Work, you can apply for:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a grant to help pay for practical support with your work</li>
  <li>support with managing your mental health at work</li>
  <li>money to pay for communication support at job interviews</li>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="practical-support-with-your-work">Practical support with your work</h2>

<p>Access to Work could give you a grant to help pay for things like:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>specialist equipment and assistive software</li>
  <li>support workers, like a <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> interpreter, a job coach or a travel buddy</li>
  <li>costs of travelling to work, if you cannot use public transport</li>
  <li>adaptations to your vehicle so you can get to work</li>
  <li>physical changes to your workplace</li>
</ul>

<p>Your workplace can include your home if you work from there some or all of the time.</p>

<p>If you get an Access to Work grant, it will not affect any other benefits you get and you will not have to pay it back.</p>

<p>You or your employer may need to pay some costs up front and claim them back later.</p>
