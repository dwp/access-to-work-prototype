<h1>Access to Work (AtW) prototype</h1>

Welcome to the Access to Work prototype.

This prototype documents the user journeys for the Access to Work service. 

This is an updated version of the AtW prototype which runs on the latest gov.uk prototype kit (v13.16.2), the latest gov.uk frontend (5.10.0) & updates the prototype with the latest gov.uk identity and brand introduced in June 2025. 

<h2>Previous Access to Work prototype (before May 2025)</h2>

This version of the prototype was outdated and needed updating as it runs on v9 of the gov.uk prototype kit & was unable to be upgraded to v13 & also ran on an old version of node (v10).
